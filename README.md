A program that allows you to Add, Move, Delete, and Rotate points in a shape.

There is interface to do things other than a display of information, instead you have to press the Shortcuts:
| Shortut        | Action

| Ctrl+R | Set the editing mode to rotating the points of the selected shape.     |  
| Ctrl+L | Set the editing mode to change the point of rotation for the selected shape.      |

| Ctrl+I | Set the background to an image if the editing mode is changing the background. |
